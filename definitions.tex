\section{Geometric Set Cover}

In the geometric set cover problem we are are given
$\sets$ -- set of objects, $\points$ -- set of points.
The task is to choose $\sol \subseteq \sets$ such that
every point in $\points$ is inside some element from $\sol$
and $|\sol|$ is minimal.

In the parametrized setting for a given $k$,
we only look for a solution $\sol$ such that $|\sol| \le k$.


In the weighted setting, there is some given weight function
$f : \sets \rightarrow \mathbb{R^+}$,
and we would like to minimize $\sum_{R \in \sol} f(R)$.

\section{Approximation}

Let us recall some of the definitions related to approximation problems
that will be used in the following sections.

\begin{defi}
A \textbf{polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS)}
for a minimization problem $\Pi$
is a family of algorithms $\cal{A}_\epsilon$ for
every $\epsilon > 0$,
such that $\cal{A}_\epsilon$ takes an instance $I$ of $\Pi$
and in polynomial time
finds a solution that is within a factor
($1+\epsilon$) of being optimal.
That means the reported solution has weight at most
$(1+\epsilon)opt(I)$, where $opt(I)$ is the weight
of an optimal solution for $I$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
Problem is \textbf{APX-hard} if assuming P $\neq$ NP,
there exists such $\epsilon > 0$
such that there is no polynomial time $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm.
\end{defi}

\section{$\delta$-extensions}

TODO PLACEHOLDER for introductory text

$\delta$-extensions is one of the
modifications to a problem, that makes geometric set cover problem easier,
it has been already used in literature (place some refrence here).

\begin{defi}\textbf{$\delta$-extensions for segments}
For any $\delta > 0$ and center-symmetric gemetric object $L$ with
centre of symmetry $S = (x_s, y_s)$,
a $\delta$-extension of this object, $L^{+\delta}$,
is an object without border, but with all vertices extended by $\delta d$,
i.e. $ L^{+\delta} =
\{ (x, y) \in L : (1 - \delta)\cdot(x - x_s, y - y_s) + (x_s, y_s)\}$.
\end{defi}


A relaxed cover problem with $\delta$-extensions
requires to cover all the points in $\points$
with $\delta$-extended objects (which always 
include no less points than the objects
before $\delta$-extensions). 
We also look for solution not larger than
optimal solution for the original problem,
so it does not have to be optimal for cover problem with 
objects after $\delta$-extensions.


\begin{defi}\textbf{Cover problem with $\delta$-extensions}
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be an optimization cover problem 
that takes as an input instance $I$
and outputs a minimal solution $\mathcal{R}^{opt}$, such that
$\mathcal{R}^{opt}$ covers $I$.

We define an optimization cover problem $\mathcal{P}$
with $\delta$-extensions as a problem which
takes an input instance $I$,
and outputs a solution $\mathcal{R}$, such that $\delta$-extended set
$\{ R^{+\delta} :  R \in \mathcal{R} \}$ covers $I$
and is no worse than the optimal solution for the problem without
extensions, i.e. $|\mathcal{R}| \le |\mathcal{R}^{opt}|$.
\end{defi}


\begin{defi}\textbf{PTAS with $\delta$-extensions}
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be an optimization cover problem 
that takes as an input instance $I$
and outputs a minimal solution $\mathcal{R}^{opt}$, such that
$\mathcal{R}^{opt}$ covers $I$.


We define a PTAS for cover problem $\mathcal{P}$
with $\delta$-extensions as a problem which
takes as an input instance $I$,
and outputs a solution $\mathcal{R}$, such that $\delta$-extended set
$\{ R^{+\delta} :  R \in \mathcal{R} \}$ covers $I$
and is within a $(1+\epsilon)$ factor of the optimal
solution for this problem without
extensions, i.e. $(1+\epsilon)|\mathcal{R}| \le |\mathcal{R}^{opt}|$.

\end{defi}
