\section{Geometric Set Cover}

Define geometric set cover problem where you
are given
$\sets$ -- set of objects, $\points$ -- set of points
and you need to choose $\sol \subset \sets$ such that
every point in $\points$ is inside some element from $\sol$
and $|\sol|$ is minimal.

In parametrized setting for given $k$,
we only look among such $\sol$, that $|\sol| \le k$.


In weighted setting, there is some given function
$f : \sets \rightarrow \mathbb{R^+}$,
and we minimize $\sum_{R \in \sol} f(R)$.

\section{Approximation}

Let's recall some of the definitions related to approximation problems
that will be used in the following sections.

\begin{defi}
A \textbf{polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS)}
is a family of algorithms $A_\epsilon$ for
every $\epsilon > 0$,
that takes an instance $I$ of a minimization problem
and in polynomial time,
finds a solution that is within a factor
($1+\epsilon$) of being optimal. That means
it has weight at most
$(1+\epsilon)opt(I)$, where $opt(I)$ is a weight
of the optimal solution for $I$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
Problem is \textbf{APX-hard} if there exists such $\epsilon > 0$
so that $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation problem is NP-hard.
\end{defi}

\section{$\delta$-extensions}

\begin{defi}\textbf{$\delta$-extensions for segments}
For any $\delta > 0$ and segment $L = \{(x_a, y_a), (x_b, y_b)\}$
of length $d = \sqrt{(x_a - x_b)^2 + (y_a - y_b)^2}$,
a $\delta$-extension of this segment, $L^{+\delta}$, is an open segment
parallel to $L$, but with both ends extended by $\delta d$,
i.e. if we denote vector $t = (x_b - x_a, y_b - y_a)$,
$ L^{+\delta}
= \{ (x_a, y_a) - \delta\cdot t, (x_b, y_b) + \delta\cdot t \}$
\end{defi}

A relaxed cover problem with $\delta$-extensions
requires to cover all the points in $\points$
with objects with $\delta$-extensions (which always 
include no less points than the objects
before $\delta$-extensions). 
We also look for solution not larger than
optimal solution for the original problem,
so it doesn't have to be optimal for cover problem with 
objects after $\delta$-extensions.


\begin{defi}\textbf{Cover problem with $\delta$-extensions}
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be an optimization cover problem 
that takes as an input instance $I$
and outputs a minimal solution $\mathcal{R}^{opt}$, such that
$\mathcal{R}^{opt}$ covers $I$.

We define an optimization cover problem $\mathcal{P}$
with $\delta$-extensions as a problem which
takes an input instance $I$,
and outputs a solution $\mathcal{R}$, such that $\delta$-extended set
$\{ R^{+\delta} :  R \in \mathcal{R} \}$ covers $I$
and is no worse than the optimal solution for the problem without
extensions, i.e. $|\mathcal{R}| \le |\mathcal{R}^{opt}|$.
\end{defi}


\begin{defi}\textbf{PTAS with $\delta$-extensions}
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be an optimization cover problem 
that takes as an input instance $I$
and outputs a minimal solution $\mathcal{R}^{opt}$, such that
$\mathcal{R}^{opt}$ covers $I$.


We define a PTAS for cover problem $\mathcal{P}$
with $\delta$-extensions as a problem which
takes as an input instance $I$,
and outputs a solution $\mathcal{R}$, such that $\delta$-extended set
$\{ R^{+\delta} :  R \in \mathcal{R} \}$ covers $I$
and is within a $(1+\epsilon)$ factor of the optimal
solution for this problem without
extensions, i.e. $(1+\epsilon)|\mathcal{R}| \le |\mathcal{R}^{opt}|$.

\end{defi}
