\begin{tw}{
	\textbf{(FPT for weighted segment cover with $\delta$-extensions)}.
	There exists an algorithm that given a family $\sets$ of
	$n$ weighted segments (in any direction),
	a set of $m$ points $\points$
	and a parameter $k$,
	runs in time $f(k) \cdot (nm)^c$ for some computable function $f$ and constant $c$,

	such that $|\sol| \le k$ and $\sol^{+\delta}$ covers all points in $\points$.

To solve this problem we will introduce kernel for slightly different
problem: Weighted segment cover of points and segments.
In shortcut: WSCPS.

\begin{lemma}
	\textbf{(Algorithm for kernel of WSCPS)}.
	There exists an algorithm that given a family $\sets$ of
	$n$ weighted segments (in any direction),
	a set of $m_1$ points $\points_1$ and $m_2$ segments $\points_2$
	and a parameter $k$,
	runs in time $f(k) \cdot g(m_1, m_2) \cdot n^c$ for some computable functions $f, g$ and constant $c$,
	and outputs a subfamily $sol \subseteq \sets$
	such that $|\sol| \le k$ and $\sol$ covers all points in $\points_1$ and all segments in $\points_2$. 
\end{lemma}
\paragraph{Proof}
Only sketch for now.

We can compute dynamic programming $dp(A, B, z)$ --
the best cost to cover at least whole segment $A, B$
using at most $z$ segments.
$A, B$ are all interesting points -- ends of any segment given on the input or points given on the input.
We can compute it in polynomial time.

Then we can create a new double weighted set (original weight,
number of used segments from $\sets$) -- $\sets_2$
that has only segments which never cover partially any segment from $\points_2$
(covers the whole segment or doesn't cover at all).
In such $\sets_2$ we can find solution $\sol$ where any 2 segments
have empty intersection (don't cover each other and don't meet at the ends).
Because if we had such solution, we can merge these two segments and
such segment there's also in $\sets_2$.

In that case we can find kernel of $\sets_2$ of size $k\cdot(m_1 + 2m_2)^2$,
because we only need to take the best weight covering some subset of $\points_1 \cup \points_2$.

\begin{lemma}
	\textbf{Kernel in WSCPS}.
	For segment cover, there is a kernel of size $f(k)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
	If the biggest $(1/delta)^{k+1}$ spaces between points are filled,
	the whole segment is filled after $\delta$-extensions of segments.
\end{lemma}

\subsection{What is missing}
We don't know FPT for axis-pararell segments without $\delta$-extensions.
