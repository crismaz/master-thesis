\chapter{Geometric Set Cover with segments}

\section{FPT for segments}
In this section we consider the fixed-parameter tractable
algorithms for unweighted geometric set cover with segments.
Setting where segments are limited to be axis-parallel
(or limited to constant number of directions) has an FPT
algorithm already present in literature.
We present an FPT algorithm for unweighted geometric set cover
with segments, where segments are in arbitrary directions.

\subsection{Axis-parallel segments}
You can find this in Platypus book. (TODO add referece)

We show an $\mathcal{O}(2^k)$-time branching algorithm.
The algorithm covers one of the points with
a segment in one of the directions greedily until
it covers all points or decide the is no solution of size $k$.

Let us take
the point $a$ which is the smallest 
among points that are not yet covered
in the lexicographic ordering
of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
We need to cover $a$ with some of the remaining segments.

Branch over choice of one of the coordinates $x$ or $y$.
Among segments that share this coordinate with $a$,
we greedily choose the segment that covers the most points.
As $a$ was the smallest in the lexicographical order,
then all points that one of the coordinates with $a$,
they have larger second coordinate. Therefore
if we choose the segment that covers the most
points $s$, it would
be the segment that have the end with highest second coordinate.
It also hold that every other segment covering $a$
in this direction does not cover any point that
is not covered by $s$. Therefore greedy choice
of this segments is optimal.

If after $k$ steps we do not cover all of the points, there is no solution
of size at most $k$.

TODO: Maybe split it into theorem + algorithm + explanation like in 
section
\ref{segments_in_arbitrary_direction}

TODO: Should it use Remark template?

The same algorithm can be used for segments in $d$ directions,
where we branch over $d$ directions and it runs in complexity $\mathcal{O}(d^k)$.

\subsection{Segments in arbitrary directions}
In this section we consider setting where segments are not constrained
to only $d$ directions. 
We present a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm,
where parameter is the size of the solution.

\label{segments_in_arbitrary_direction}
\begin{tw}{
	\label{segment_cover_fpt}
	\textbf{(FPT for segment cover)}.
	There exists an algorithm that given a family $\sets$ of
	$n$ segments (in any direction),
	a set of $m$ points $\points$
	and a parameter $k$,
	runs in time $f(k) \cdot (nm)^c$ for some computable function f and constant c,
	and outputs a subfamily $\sol \subseteq \sets$
	such that $|\sol| \le k$ and $\sol$ covers all points in $\points$,
	or determines that such a set $\sol$ does not exist.
}\end{tw}

We will need the following lemmas.

\begin{lemma}
   \label{fpt_reduction}
   Given an instance $(\sets, \points)$ of the segment cover problem,
   without a loss of generality we can assume that
   no segment covers a superset of what another segment covers.
   That is, for any distinct $A, B \in \sets$, we have
   $A \cap C \not \subseteq B \cap C$ and $A \cap C \not \supseteq B \cap C$.
\end{lemma}   
   
\begin{proof} Trivial. \end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{fpt_long_lines}
	Given an instance $(\sets, \points)$ of the segment cover problem,
	if there exists a line $L$ with at least
	$k+1$ points on it, then there exists a subset $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \sets$,
	$|\mathcal{A}| \le k$,
	such that every solution $\sol$ with $|\sol| \le k$
	satisfies $|\mathcal{A} \cap \sol| \ge 1$.
	Moreover, such a subset can be found in polynomial time.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

First we use Lemma \ref{fpt_reduction}.

Let us enumerate the points from $\points$ that lie on $L$ as $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_t$
in the order in which they appear on $L$.
Every segment that is not collinear with $L$ can cover at most one of these
points. Therefore, in any solution of size not larger than $k$,
among any $k$ of these points at least one must
be covered with segment collinear with $L$.

Therefore, every solution needs to take one of the segments collinear
with $L$ that covers any of the points
$x_1, x_2, \ldots x_k$. After using reduction from Lemma \ref{fpt_reduction},
there are at most $k$ such segments that are distinct.
\end{proof}

We are ready to prove Theorem \ref{segment_cover_fpt}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{segment_cover_fpt}.]\leavevmode

%As long as there is a line with more than $k$ points, do branching.
%Let's name points on this line $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_t$
%in order they appear on the line.

%So we choose on which point the chosen segment on this line
%will start. Of course we have to take at least one segment
%covering at least one point among first $k+1$ points,
%because covering all of them with only segments
%on different lines we would use
%exactly $k+1$ segments (any of them can't contain more than
%one point from this line).

\subparagraph{Algorithm.}
First we use Lemma \ref{fpt_reduction}.

Next, we present a recursive algorithm. Given an instance of the problem:

\begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)}]
\item If there exist a line with at least $k+1$ points from $\points$, we branch over
adding to the solution one of the at most $k$ possible segments
provided by Lemma \ref{fpt_long_lines}; name this segment $S$.
Then we find a solution $\sol$
for the problem for points $\points - S$, segments $\sets - \{S\}$,
and parameter $k-1$. We return $\sol \cup \{S\}$.
\item If every line has at most $k$ points on it and $|\points| > k^2$,
then answer \texttt{NO}.
\item If $|\points| \le k^2$, solve the problem by brute force:
check all subsets of $\sets$ of size at most $k$.
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Correctness.}

Lemma \ref{fpt_long_lines} proves that at least one segment that we
branch over in (1) must be present in every solution $\sol$ with $|\sol| \le k$.
Therefore, the recursive call can find a solution, provided there exists one.

In (2) the answer is no, because every line covers no more than $k$ points
from $\points$, which implies the same about every segment from $\sets$.
Under this assumption
we can cover only $k^2$ points with a solution of size $k$, which is less
than $|\points|$.

Checking all possible solutions in (3) is trivially correct.


\subparagraph{Complexity.}

In the leaves of recursion we have $|\points| \le k^2$, so $|\sets| \le k^4$, because
every segments can be uniquely identified by the two extreme points it covers
(by Lemma \ref{fpt_reduction}). Therefore, there are $\binom{k^4}{k}$
possible solutions to check, each can be checked in time $O(k|\points|)$.
Therefore, (3) takes time $k^{O(k)}$.


In this branching algorithm our parameter $k$ is decreased with every
recursive call, so we have at most $k$ levels of recursion with
branching over $k$ possibilites. Candidates to branch over
can be found on each level in time $O(nm \log(nm))$.

Reduction from Lemma \ref{fpt_reduction} can be implemented in time $O(n^2m)$.

It follows that the overall complexity is $O(n^2m + nm \log(nm) \cdot f(k))$
\end{proof}
